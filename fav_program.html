  <h1>What the program does</h1>

  <p>This program allows you to play a game of slots.  A player would start off with $500.  The game would allow the player to wager as much or as little as they want, and then spin the wheel.
  <p>Depending on the combination of three different slots, they could either win the wager, lose the wager, or they could advance on to a special interactive round.  </p>
  <p>The interactive rounds would be a randomly select one of three possible games.  The games are Hangman, word scramble, and trivia.
  <p>If the player wins the special round of the interactive game, then they would win their wager.
    <p>Here is a <a href="https://github.com/tango1542/Python-Casino"target="_blank"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span></a> to Python Casino on Git Hub</p>
  <p>Here's some snippets of the code....
    <pre><code> money=500   #sets the initial amount of money you have

    print ("Welcome to the Python Casino")
    print ("You have $%d to start with" % money)<br>
    choice=""
    wager="5"
    while True:

        spun=input("Press enter to spin  (c to change wager)(q to quit)  \n")
